# KO taming
A fabric mod adding the possibility for players to tame mobs by KOing them.

# How to use
First, download the fabric loader installer [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/). Then, make sure to install the correct version (mc version KO-Taming-...+MC VERSION.jar).

Then put the `.jar` file into your `mods` folder. To easily configure this mod, use [cloth config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and [mod menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu). They are mods too, so they need to be put into your `mods` folder as well.
